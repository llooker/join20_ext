# Looker Extension Hello World (JavaScript)

This repository demonstrates a bare bones Looker extension using javascript

It uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for writing your extension, the [React Extension SDK](https://github.com/looker-open-source/extension-sdk-react) for interacting with Looker, and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for building your code.

## Getting Started for Development

1. Clone or download a copy of this template to your development machine

2. Navigate (`cd`) to the template directory on your system

3. Install the dependencies with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

   > You may need to update your Node version or use a [Node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to change your Node version.

4) Start the development server

   ```
   yarn start
   ```

   THe extension is now running and serving the JavaScript at http://localhost:8080/bundle.js.

5) Log in to Looker and create a new project.

   This is found under **Develop** => **Manage LookML Projects** => **New LookML Project**.

   Select "Blank Project" as your "Starting Point". This will create a new project with no files.

   1. The extension project has a `manifest.lkml` file.

   Either drag & upload this file into your Looker project, or create a `manifest.lkml` with the same content. Change the `id`, `label`, or `url` as needed.

   ```
   project_name: "helloworld-js"
   application: helloworld-js {
    label: "Helloworld (JavaScript)"
    url: "http://localhost:8080/bundle.js"
    entitlements: {
    core_api_methods: ["me"]
   }
   ```

6. Create a `model` LookML file in your project. The name doesn't matter but the convention is to name it the same as the project.

- Add a connection in this model.
- [Configure the model you created](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/getting-started/create-projects#configuring_a_model) so that it has access to the selected connection.

7. Connect the project to Git. This can be done in multiple ways:

- Create a new repository on GitHub or a similar service, and follow the instructions to [connect your project to Git](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/getting-started/setting-up-git-connection)
- A simpler but less powerful approach is to set up git with the "Bare" repository option which does not require connecting to an external Git Service.

8. Commit the changes and deploy them to production through the Project UI.

9. Reload the page and click the `Browse` dropdown menu. You will see the extension in the list.

- The extension will load the JavaScript from the `url` provided in the `application` definition/
- Reloading the extension page will bring in any new code changes from the extension template although some changes will hot reload.

## Extension Entitlements

Entitlements are defined in the project manifest file for the extension.

Resources required by the extension (Looker API methods for example) must be defined in entitlements. This extension uses the `me` api method, as such it is defined in the entitlements.

## Deployment

The process above describes how to develope the extension. Once development has completed, the production version of the extension maybe deployed as follows:

1. In the extension project directory build the extension by running `yarn build`.
2. Drag and drop the generated `dist/bundle.js` file into the Looker project interface
3. Modify the `manifest.lkml` to use `file` instead of `url`:

   ```
   project_name: "helloworld-js"
   application: helloworld-js {
    label: "Helloworld (JavaScript)"
    file: "bundle.js"
    entitlements: {
    core_api_methods: ["me"]
   }
   ```

## Notes

- Webpack's module splitting is not currently supported.
- The template uses Looker's component library and styled components. Neither of these libraries are required so you may remove and replace them with a component library of your own choice,
